Hello!
This application models the spread of infection in a group of people according to specified parameters: group size, frequency of the disease and the infectiousness of the disease (how many people can one patient infect).
The disease spreads in the background, so the user always has access to the screen and can, for example, select an additional target to infect.
I have currently solved the problem with background processing of the disease process so the program can run with a large group size.
